# deiGo Compiler
Compilers - compiler for the subset of the language Go. Coded in C using Lex & Yacc. Should be using LLVM to generate machine code and *actually* compile but that step was skipped.

This project is not meant to be contributed to or used. Therefore, there isn't a "How to run" section.
